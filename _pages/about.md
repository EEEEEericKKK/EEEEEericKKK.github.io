> Whenever you feel like criticizing any one, just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had. - F. Scott Fitzgerald

I'm currently an undergraduate student in Yao Class 03, [IIIS](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), graduating in 2024. My major is Computer Science and Technology under the AI curriculum.

My research interests lie in **Embodied AI, Language Models and Computer Vision**, especially how they can cooperate with each other. A long preserving goal of mine is to build agents that can physically interact with the real world, which requires development of both perception (vision, multi-modal) and decision making (RL, LLM, etc.).
